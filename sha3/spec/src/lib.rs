//! SHA-3 as FIPS 202 writes it.
//!
//! This crate is a specification of SHA-3 written in the terms the *Standard*
//! uses, rather than those an implementation uses, so that it can be read next
//! to the document:
//!
//! * the state is the 5-by-5-by-`w` array of bits `A[x, y, z]` of Sec. 3.1,
//!   and messages are bit strings -- of arbitrary length, as the Standard's
//!   are: [`bits::BitStr`] is opaque to the extraction precisely so that the
//!   proofs read it as a list of bits with no length bound, rather than as a
//!   `Vec` whose model stops at `usize::MAX` on whatever the target is, and
//!   [`nat::Nat`] is opaque for the same reason one level up: `len(M)` is a
//!   nonnegative integer, so counting bits cannot fail and no bound on the
//!   input reaches a proof;
//! * every function is one numbered Algorithm, with the Steps in the
//!   Standard's order and the Standard's names;
//! * nothing is precomputed that the Standard computes: `ρ`'s offsets come
//!   from the `(x, y)` walk of Algorithm 2, and `ι`'s round constants from the
//!   `rc` LFSR of Algorithm 5;
//! * the permutation is generic in the width: `KECCAK-p[b, n_r]` for any of
//!   the seven `b` in Table 1, not only `b = 1600`.
//!
//! It is therefore slow, and it is meant to be. The point is that a reader
//! with the PDF open can check it line by line.

//! The document is FIPS 202, <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202>. The crate
//! extracts to Lean (`cargo hax extract pedantic-sha3`, from the
//! repository root); `README.md` lists the handful of places where the
//! extraction needed something other than the Standard's own phrasing.

// The loops below are the Standard's "For all triples (x, y, z) such that …"
// quantifiers written out; the index variables are exactly the point, so the
// lint that would have us iterate the arrays instead does not apply here.
#![allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)]
// `0^n` and the zeros of `pad10*1` are written as a `push` per bit. The
// Standard says only that the string is `n` zeros and leaves the construction
// open; a `push` loop is what extracts, and `vec![false; n]` and `Vec::extend`
// do not.
