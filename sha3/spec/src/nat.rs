//! The nonnegative integers the Standard counts with.
//!
//! FIPS 202 counts the way mathematics counts. `len(M)`, the `d` of
//! `KECCAK[c](N, d)`, the `j` of `pad10*1` and the block index of Algorithm 8
//! are nonnegative integers, and the Standard bounds none of them. A machine
//! word is the wrong shape for that — not because the numbers are large, but
//! because a word puts a bound on `len(M)` into the *specification*, where the
//! Standard has none, and then every proof written against the specification
//! has to carry that bound as a precondition.
//!
//! So lengths are a [`Nat`]: opaque to the extraction, and modelled in
//! `Assumptions/TypesExternal.lean` as Lean's `Nat`, which does not stop.
//! Addition and multiplication are total there, so `8 * len(M)` and
//! `len(N) + len(pad)` are unconditional and no bound on the input reaches the
//! contracts. What stays partial is only what is partial in the mathematics or
//! at the boundary: `a - b` where `b > a`, division by zero, and handing a
//! value back down to the fixed-width layer as a `usize`.
//!
//! ## The `u128` underneath
//!
//! The model is exact on every state this crate can reach, and the argument is
//! the allocator's, not the Standard's. The bits counted here are held in a
//! `Vec<u8>`, which is at most `isize::MAX` bytes, so the longest [`BitStr`]
//! that can exist has fewer than `2^67` bits on any target; `pad10*1` adds at
//! most `r + 1 < 2^11` more, and the sponge's cursor `i * r` stays below the
//! length of the padded string. Against `2^128` that is sixty bits of
//! headroom, and it is headroom over what can be *allocated*, not over what
//! someone might pass. A `u64` could not make that argument: `8 * isize::MAX`
//! overflows one on a 64-bit target.
//!
//! Where a `u128` could nonetheless overflow, the operation is written
//! `checked_*` and panics: in the one place the model and the implementation
//! could part company, the implementation stops rather than wrapping, in
//! release as well as debug.
//!
//! [`BitStr`]: crate::bits::BitStr
