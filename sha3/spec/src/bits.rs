//! Bit strings and the operations on them — FIPS 202, Sec. 2.3 and App. B.1.
//!
//! The Standard's objects are bit strings of arbitrary length, so this module
//! has two layers.
//!
//! [`BitStr`] is the arbitrary-length one: messages, the padded message `P`,
//! and the output `Z`. It is **opaque to the extraction** — the Lean side does
//! not see the representation below, but a hand-written model in
//! `Assumptions/TypesExternal.lean` that reads it as a plain list of bits, of
//! any length whatsoever. That is the point of the type: the Standard puts no
//! bound on `len(M)`, and neither should the specification.
//!
//! The representation here is bit-packed, one bit per bit rather than the byte
//! per bit a `Vec<bool>` would spend. Lengths and bit positions are a
//! [`Nat`](crate::nat::Nat), whose model is Lean's `Nat`: unbounded, so that
//! `len(S)` is an operation that cannot fail and no bound on the length of a
//! message reaches anything proved against this specification. `Nat`'s own
//! docs give the argument for why its `u128` cannot overflow on a string that
//! was allocated; a `u64` length could not make that argument, since
//! `8 * isize::MAX` overflows one on a 64-bit target, and a `usize` length
//! could not either — `8 * m.len()` overflows a 32-bit target at 512 MB.
//!
//! The fixed-width layer is the free functions below, on `&[Bit]`. The state
//! of the permutation is `b` bits for a `b` in Table 1, at most 1600, so
//! nothing there needs to reach past a `usize` and the plain slice stays.
//!
//! Where a condition the Standard states is checked, it is a plain `assert!`,
//! which extracts to a `massert` in the generated Lean: `Trunc_s` needs
//! `s <= len(X)`, `h2b` needs `n <= 8m`.
