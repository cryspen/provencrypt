# The round constants: the LFSR against the table

The implementations carry the twenty-four round constants as a table of `u64`s,
the way implementations do.  `pedantic-sha3` does not carry them at all:
it derives each bit from the linear feedback shift register of FIPS 202
Algorithm 5, as the standard defines it (`rcBitAt`, built on `rcOf`).

The two therefore have to be reconciled once, and this module is that once.  It
is a finite check -- 24 constants, 64 bits each -- and it is done by `decide`,
so the kernel replays the shift register itself.  No `native_decide`: the whole
development stays on Lean's three standard axioms.

Bit `z` of round constant `i_r` is `rc(j + 7 i_r)` when `z = 2^j - 1` for some
`j ≤ l`, and zero otherwise; that the table's other 57 bits per constant really
are zero is part of what is checked here.
